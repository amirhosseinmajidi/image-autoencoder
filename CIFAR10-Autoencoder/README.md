# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction with Keras & TensorFlow

This project is a practical exploration of building and improving autoencoder models for the task of image reconstruction. It begins with a simple autoencoder and progressively evolves towards more complex and efficient architectures like Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) and a U-Net-style model to handle complex color datasets like CIFAR-10.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project was designed with the following educational and practical objectives:

-   **Learn the fundamentals of autoencoders:** Starting with a simple dense model on the MNIST dataset to understand the core encoder-decoder structure.
-   **Upgrade to a Convolutional Architecture:** Understand the necessity of using convolutional layers (CAE) to preserve the spatial structure of images when working with more complex datasets like CIFAR-10.
-   **Analyze and Improve the Model:** Evaluate the initial results, understand the limitations (e.g., blurry output images), and then apply targeted improvements.
-   **Implement Advanced Techniques:**
    -   Utilize `Conv2DTranspose` layers for more effective, learned upsampling.
    -   Employ **smart training callbacks** like `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting and `ReduceLROnPlateau` to dynamically adjust the learning rate.
    -   Implement a **U-Net-style architecture** with skip connections to achieve high-fidelity image reconstruction with fine details.
